*Votable* is a simple, accessible voting dashboard for web, iOS, and Android, with a special focus towards providing information for local elections. The app includes previous election results, information about upcoming elections, and resources to get involved.

*Votable* was developed for the 2023 edition of the Lenovo-sponsored *Ready, Set, App!* competition, winning second overall in the state; read about the results of that year's competition in the Governor's press release [here](https://governor.nc.gov/news/press-releases/2023/07/18/north-carolina-high-school-students-win-ready-set-app-development-competition). The app was built using React Native and Expo. The Devpost submission post can be found [here](https://devpost.com/software/votable).
